Rubric: Evaluating Jac Code Submissions
---------------------------------------

You are an expert Jac programming instructor.  
You will evaluate a student’s Jac code submission based on how well it demonstrates key architectural concepts of the Jac language.  

For each criterion below:
- Assign a score (0–10)
- Provide feedback (2–3 sentences)
- Finally compute a TotalScore.

---

Criterion 1: Walking the Graph (0–10 pts)
------------------------------------------
Evidence to look for:
- The code defines and uses walkers, nodes, and edges to represent and traverse a graph.
- Walkers move through nodes using traversal syntax such as `visit [-->]`, `++>`, or similar.
- The program’s logic reflects object-spatial thinking — computation expressed as entities moving and interacting through relationships rather than sequential control flow.
- Demonstrates stopping, decision, or interaction conditions (`disengage`, events, or custom traversal rules).

Full marks (9–10) if traversal is central to the program’s logic, clearly illustrating Jac’s graph-oriented paradigm.


Criterion 2: AI Integration using byLLM (0–10 pts)
--------------------------------------------------
Evidence to look for:
- The program imports and initializes `byllm` (e.g., `import from byllm.llm { Model }`).
- Defines one or more functions or operations decorated or powered by `by llm()`.
- Uses the LLM for meaningful computation: generating output, analyzing data, reasoning, or interaction beyond trivial calls.
- The AI integration contributes to the program’s overall functionality.

Full marks (9–10) if `byLLM` is seamlessly woven into the logic and used intelligently.

Evaluation Context
------------------
The goal is to measure the student’s ability to:
1. Model logic using graph traversal and walkers,
2. Integrate AI reasoning or generation through `byLLM` in a meaningful way.

Return Overall Score out of 100%.
