# Number Memory Game (Jac + byLLM)

A simple **Number Memory Game** implemented in [Jac](https://jac-lang.org) that demonstrates three key concepts from the tutorial:

* **Walking the Graph**: The game uses Jacâ€™s **object-spatial architecture** with walkers, nodes, and edges. Each game level is represented as a `Level` node, and the `NumberMemoryGame` walker traverses from one level node to the next using `++>`.
* **Persistence**: The game state is stored in a chain of `Level` nodes. This means the playerâ€™s progress (difficulty and input history) persists in the graph, so the game can resume from the last saved level.
* **AI Enhancement with byLLM**: An LLM (via the `byllm` library) is used to both:

  * Generate encouraging, non-deterministic feedback.
  * Adjust the difficulty level based on the correctness of the playerâ€™s response.

## Features

* Digits flash one by one (like a blinking cursor).
* Player must recall and type the sequence.
* Game difficulty automatically adjusts up or down using an **LLM**.
* Motivational feedback is generated by the **LLM**, making the game feel more natural.
* Graph traversal ensures **automatic persistence** of past levels.

## Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file with:

```
jaclang
byllm
```

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game

1. Save the game code into a file, e.g. `number_memory_game.jac`.
2. Run it using the Jac CLI:
You need a valid gemini api key..its free!!

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
jac run number_memory_game.jac
```

3. The game will:

   * Start at difficulty **1**.
   * Flash a sequence of digits.
   * Prompt you to enter what you saw.
   * Use the LLM to give feedback and adjust difficulty.
   * Move the walker to a new `Level` node, chaining gameplay.

## Example Gameplay

```
Are you ready for level 1? [Y/N] y
Get ready...
Starting soon...
Here we go!
5
Enter digits you saw (no spaces): 5
ðŸŽ‰ Awesome! You nailed it! Let's step it up.
```

## Features

* **(Walking the Graph):**
  The walker (`NumberMemoryGame`) visits `Level` nodes via `++>` edges. This transforms conventional game logic into graph traversal.

* **(Persistence):**
  Each new level is stored as a `Level` node in the graph. If you restart, the walker can continue from the latest node â€” showing how Jac enables **state persistence** without extra database code.

* **(AI with byLLM):**
  Functions `adjust_difficulty` and `encouraging_feedback` are powered by an LLM, making the gameplay adaptive and engaging beyond simple deterministic rules.

## Cloud Ready (Optional)

Jac is **scale-agnostic**. By serving the game:

```bash
jac serve number_memory_game.jac
```

you can expose the walker as an API endpoint, making the same code runnable in the cloud without changes.
